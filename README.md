### Notes

Feel free to comment and open issues since this is my first experience on Ruby and Rails. The question is a little confusing and does not specify the UI requirements so it might not be what you've expected and I also did it in a limited time so I might not cover it all (I have not much experience on frontend side too ðŸ˜–). I keep the code clean as I possibly could (since I'm new to Ruby ðŸ˜…), if there's a better way to implement also feel free to leave advice. I'll study harder and further to close all opened issues that I possibly could ðŸ’¯
