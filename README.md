### Notes

Feel free to comment and open issues since this is my first experience on Ruby and Rails. The question is a little confusing and does not specify the UI requirements so this UI you've interact is what I understand from the question (I have not much experience on frontend side too ðŸ˜–). I'll study further and try to close all opened issues.
